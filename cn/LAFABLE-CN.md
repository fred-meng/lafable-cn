# General
* THE TEAM  
团队 `巡游团队`
* Developers & Testers  
开发和测试人员  
    > It is good to have at least a few developers and testers around so that the Product Owner and Stroll Master have people to boss around.  
    > 怎么也得有几名开发和测试人员围绕在产品拥有者和巡游主管的身边，以便让他们拥有老板的感觉。
* Stroll Master  
巡游主管 `漫步大师`  
	> A team’s Stroll Master acts as a coach for the team—yelling and berating the team at every opportunity. Always acting with an eye toward continuous improvement, a good Stroll Master can find innumerable ways for team members to improve and is not shy about sharing these with them. The best teams are staffed by a Certified StrollMaster who participated in a grueling two-day course to earn that certification.  
	> 巡游主管充当团队的教练，从不放过任何一个大喊大叫和斥责团队的机会。一个优秀的巡游主管总是着眼于团队的持续改进，他能发现无数的团队需要改进的地方，并且毫不吝惜地分享给团队。最好的团队通常都配备一名经过认证的巡游主管，他们可是参加了为期两天的艰苦训练才获得的认证。
* Architect  
架构师  
	> Residing in an ivory tower, positioned well away from the need to dirty his or her hands with code, a LAFABLE project architect is responsible for giving the team lots of unsolicited advice. If anything goes wrong on a project, the Architect is required by LAFABLE to side with the product owner and Stroll Master in insisting that if the team had just built what was specified, the project would have been a success.  
	> 在LAFABLE，架构师身处高高的象牙塔上，无须担心编写代码这种卑微小事会弄脏他们高贵的手，不管团队是否需要，他们只负责提出大量的建议。如果一个项目出现了任何问题，LAFABLE要求架构师与产品拥有者和巡游主管站在一起，并坚定地遵守：只要团队构建了指定的内容，项目一定会取得成功。
* Product Owner  
产品拥有者  
	> In LAFABLE, the product owner is responsible for making all decisions about the functionality of the product. To do that effectively, it is important for the product owner to own all the resources involved in the project—human and other.  
	> 在LAFABLE, 产品拥有者拥有关于产品功能的所有决定权。为了有效地实现这一点，产品拥有者必须拥有项目中涉及的一切资源 - 不但包括人力资源，还有其他一切！

	> During a project’s strolls, the Release Choo Choo is picking up steam and rumbling down the tracks  
	> 在项目巡游阶段，发布火车啾啾势头越来越猛，一路高歌猛进  
	> During the Stabilization phase, the Release Choo Choo is shown to be a train wreck. Train wreck! The Release Choo Choo goes off track, sliding off the top of the product backlog and crashing into reality  
	> 在稳定阶段，发布火车啾啾被证明是一列失事的火车。火车失事啦！所有人在现实中惊醒，发布火车啾啾早已偏离了产品待办列表的轨道
